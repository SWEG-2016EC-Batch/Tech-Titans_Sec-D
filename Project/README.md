# Automated Running Data Tracking System

## Project Overview

Manually tracking runners' daily miles is an inefficient and error-prone process that can hinder effective training. This project aims to automate the tracking and analysis of daily running data, calculate total and average weekly miles, and provide detailed feedback for each runner. The system helps coaches and athletes make informed decisions about training adjustments.

## Objectives

- Automate the tracking of daily running data.
- Calculate total and average weekly miles for each runner.
- Provide detailed performance feedback for each runner.

## Scope

The program tracks daily running miles for multiple runners over a week. It calculates total weekly mileage, average miles run per day, and allows searching for specific runners by name or code. It is designed for individual runners but can be scaled to support more runners if necessary.

## Solution Overview

The solution uses parallel arrays to store runners' names, their daily miles, total mileage, and average miles per day. It performs key functions such as recording daily mileage, calculating total and average miles, and searching for specific runners.

## Problem Analysis

### Problem Statement

Manual tracking of daily running mileage is inefficient and error-prone, leading to inaccurate data and delayed insights. An automated system is needed to ensure accurate data tracking, faster analysis, and better support for training optimization.



### Potential Challenges

- Input validation to prevent invalid data entries.
- Efficient data management for smooth processing and retrieval.
- Scalability to support an increasing number of runners.
- Meaningful performance feedback.
- User-friendly interface design.

## Future Extensions

- **Data Storage:** Integrate with a robust database for long-term storage and user authentication.
- **Multisport Support:** Expand to support various training activities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an interactive GUI or web-based platform.
- **Supporting More Runners:** Implement dynamic data structures for scalability.

## Conclusion

This project leverages technology to enhance athletic training by automating running data tracking and analysis, improving accuracy and efficiency, and providing real-time insights for optimizing performance.

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of data validation to prevent incorrect entries.
- Significance of a user-friendly interface for data input and retrieval.
- Value of software engineering practices and teamwork in developing a reliable and efficient system.
